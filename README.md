# Predicitng the 2016 EU referendum voting pattern

In this project, I will develop classification models to determine which features best predict whether someone voted leave or remain as well as identifying the best predictive model by proper evaluation metrics.
The dataset for this project was obtained from data.gov.uk. The voting outcome was collected in 2016 which consists of the 327 entries that represent all the areas in England. For the purpose of this project, I had to collect population data that contains socio-economic, demographic, and education variables from nomis.co.uk.
