    "In natural language processing, there are steps to follow to clean up the data. These are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Tokenization: This involves splitting data into wods and sentences.\n",
    "2. Removal stopwords: stopwords are words that have negligible meaning. Hence, they are removed from the data to increase run time and improve data quality. Stopwords are filtered before or after text processing.\n",
    "3. Stemming: This technique involves reducing words to its common base (root) by removing the suffixes.\n",
    "4. Lemmatization: This reduces words to its common base but take into consideration its morphological analysis.\n",
    "5. Part of speech (POS): This mark words in the corpus to a corresponding part of speech based on the definition and context.\n",
    "6. Regex: This is a powerful tool to apply additional filtering to data. It involves removing non-words in the textual data.\n",
    "7. Feature extraction: This convert textual data into vector of numbers. As we know machine learning cannot work with raw data directly. In the analysis, I would use bag of words feature extraction technique."

    "It was observed that our classifiers worked well on the text data. Random forest achieved 79.5% and performed slightly over logistic regression and decision tree classifier. On the other hand, naive bayes underperformed with 67% accuracy. This indicated that tree based methods work best on natural language processing problem."
